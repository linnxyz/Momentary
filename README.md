## Momentary

Momentary is an experimental mobile app built with **React Native (Expo)** for capturing short, honest thoughts.

It’s designed for moments when you just need to open up, type something out, and let it go. Notes automatically delete after a short, set amount of time. Nothing is stored on servers. Everything stays locally on your device.

## What It Does

* Write short thoughts instantly
* Notes automatically expire after a fixed time
* All data stays on the user’s phone
* No accounts
* No cloud sync
* No tracking

Momentary is private by design. Once a thought fades, it’s gone.

## Tech Stack

* React Native
* Expo
* File-based routing (Expo Router)
* Local device storage only

# Welcome to Momentary 👋

This is an **Expo** project created with `create-expo-app`.

---

## Get Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the terminal output, you’ll see options to open the app in:

* Development build
* Android emulator
* iOS simulator
* Expo Go (quickest way to test on your phone)

---

## Reset the Project

If you want a clean starting point:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the starter files into **app-example** and creates a blank **app** directory so you can rebuild from scratch.

---

## Philosophy

Momentary is built around one idea:

Some thoughts are meant to be felt — not archived.

No social features.
No timelines.
No pressure.

Just write.
And let it disappear.
